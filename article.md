# How To Use Git to Manage Your Writing Project

### Introduction

Version control isn't just for code. It's for anything you want to track, including content. Using Git to manage your next writing project give you the ability to view multiple drafts at the same time, see differences between those drafts, and even roll back to a previous verison. And if you're comfortable doing so, you can then share your work with others on GitHub or other central git repositories.

In this tutorial you'll use Git to manage a small Markdown document. You'll store an initial verison, commit it, make changes, view the difference between those changes, and review the previous version. When you're done, you'll have a workflow you can apply to your writing projects.
